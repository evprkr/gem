# Misc. Notes

## Planned Changes
* Move Buffer and Cursor to their own classes outside of Editor
* Change buffer naming scheme for better readability
* Switch 'x' and 'y' to 'rows' and 'cols' in as many contexts as possible

## Known Bugs
* Cursor sometimes flickers in odd places when redrawing the screen during scrolling
