# Misc Notes

## Planned Changes
    * Change scrolling buffer to offscreen cursor so it scrolls until the cursor is centered in the screen
    * Add popup "help" window for basic shortcuts (plugin?)
    * Implement new error handler everywhere, display errors on screen and write to log
    * Implement prompt history

## Major Changes
    * Change text editor buffer into a widget of some kind
    * Make buffers more generic and widgets the important part (ambiguous)
    * Create basic plugin API
    * Create basic color system
    * Create basic config system
    * Make a help command to search documentation

# What Do I Do Now?
    * Select Mode
    * Search Mode
    * Split Buffers
    * Tabbed Buffers
    * Improved History
    * Repeat Action

## Silly Ideas
    * What if the prompt buffer could have rows added with `Shift + Enter` so you could actually write full scripts within the prompt?
