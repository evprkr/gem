# Misc. Notes

## Planned Changes
* Add more keyboard shortcuts
* Add command line mode (with PopupInput, probably?)
* Change scrolling buffer to offscreen cursor so it scrolls until the cursor is centered in the screen
* Automatically change tabs into spaces, will be customizable

## Known Bugs
* Cursor sometimes flickers in odd places when redrawing the screen during scrolling
* Editor crashes when resizing the terminal
* Highlight groups appear to not be working, even changing ones that ARE working don't change them. That doesn't make any sense, but I'm too tired to fix it right now.
